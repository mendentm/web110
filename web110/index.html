       <p>I'm still developing my interests as I try new things but right now im really into refinishing old furniture because furniture stores love to charge an arm and a leg for cheap crap and I've also started a planted aquarium which uses real plants and has been really challenging and has made me doubt my will-power and patience but its coming along.</p>
           
      <p>I took an ITC class and was elected project manager which seemed like a great idea considering I have management experience. It was quite the challenge as group projects are notorious for one lazy person, one person who doesn't understand anything, and another who actually does the work and I was the forth, the one to had to keep the animals in the circus from eating me and each other. All that being said it was a fun time and I enjoyed and still enjoy leading teams.</p>
